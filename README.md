# Landing Page
My first attempt at manipulating a site using JavaScript. 
The section in the viewport is styled differently to other sections which are not being viewed at the moment. The corresponding navigation link is also styled. 
Clicking on a navigation link will cause the site to automatically scroll to the relevant section.
Navigation bar is also hidden when user is not scrolling.
